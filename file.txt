PROjECTS
Speech Emotion Detection https://github.com/jayesh-cmd/Speech-Emotion-Detection
I developed a model using the RAVDESS dataset to recognize human emotions from speech. The project
involved implementing feature extraction techniques such as MFCC and training machine learning models to
classify emotions like happy, sad, and angry.
Fake News Detection https://github.com/jayesh-cmd/Fake-News-Detection
I built a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake. I utilized NLP techniques such as
TF-IDF vectorization and trained models using logistic regression and random forest to enhance accuracy in
detecting misinformation.
House Price Prediction https://github.com/jayesh-cmd/House-Price-Prediction
I created a regression model to estimate house prices based on factors like location, size, and amenities. The
project involved data preprocessing, feature scaling, and training the model using linear regression to generate
reliable price predictions.

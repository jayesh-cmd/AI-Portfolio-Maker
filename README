__Overview__ :-
    This project reads a user's resume (in TXT or PDF format), extracts all the important details—name, contact, education, skills, projects—and generates a clean, modern portfolio website.
    No manual website editing: Just upload your resume, and your site is ready!

__Modules Used__ :-
   > LLM (model=llama3.2:latest_version)
   > Ollama
   > Langchain
   > Python 3
   AND
   > spaCy (NLP for name/entity extraction)
   > Regex (for email, phone, and section parsing)
   > Jinja2 + HTML/CSS (portfolio website generation)

__How It Works__ :-
   -> Text Extraction:
   -> Reads your resume as plain text (TXT works best; PDF may need conversion).
   -> Entity & Pattern Recognition:
   -> Uses spaCy and regex to extract name, email, phone, education, skills, and projects.
   -> Section Handling:
   -> Custom logic to find education, skills, and project sections—even with different resume formats.
   -> Portfolio Generation:
   -> Fills a Jinja2 HTML template with your data for a personal, professional website.

__I built this project as a personal challenge to automate portfolio creation and learn about GenAI And real-world NLP. I’m always open to feedback, collaborations, or internship opportunities—let’s connect!__ ❤️

‚û°Ô∏è Turn your resume into a live portfolio site, powered by Python and NLP. 

__Overview__ :-
    This project reads a user's resume (in TXT or PDF format), extracts all the important details‚Äîname, contact, education, skills, projects‚Äîand generates a clean, modern portfolio website.
    No manual website editing: Just upload your resume, and your site is ready!

__Modules Used__ :-
   > Python 3
   > spaCy (NLP for name/entity extraction)
   > Regex (for email, phone, and section parsing)
   > Jinja2 + HTML/CSS (portfolio website generation)

__How It Works__ :-
   -> Text Extraction:
   -> Reads your resume as plain text (TXT works best; PDF may need conversion).
   -> Entity & Pattern Recognition:
   -> Uses spaCy and regex to extract name, email, phone, education, skills, and projects.
   -> Section Handling:
   -> Custom logic to find education, skills, and project sections‚Äîeven with different resume formats.
   -> Portfolio Generation:
   -> Fills a Jinja2 HTML template with your data for a personal, professional website.

__Limitations__ ‚ö†Ô∏è :-

    Resume format sensitivity:

       -> Works best with clear sections and common layouts.
       -> May miss fields or mix up sections on highly unusual resume designs.

    PDF text extraction:

       -> Tools like pdfplumber may cause spacing/word order issues (not fully reliable).

    Not universal:

       -> Handling ‚Äúall‚Äù resume styles requires much more advanced parsing, sometimes only possible with commercial APIs.

__Experience Of What I Learned üìö__ :- 

        -> Real-world data (resumes!) is messy and hard to parse perfectly.

        -> NLP and regex are powerful, but not magic‚Äîfor ultimate flexibility, need ML-based models or paid APIs.

        -> Building robust, error-tolerant code is as important as accuracy.

__How To Use__ :-

        > Place your resume as file.txt (or convert your PDF to TXT first).

        > Run makejson.py to generate final.json.

        > Start the portfolio website (Flask app or open the HTML if static).
